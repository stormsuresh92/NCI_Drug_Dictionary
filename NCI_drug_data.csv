667935,xevinapant,"An orally available mimetic of the natural second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (Smac) and inhibitor of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs), with potential immunomodulating, apoptotic-inducing, chemo-radio-sensitizing and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration,xevinapant targets and binds to the Smac binding groove on IAPs, including the direct caspase inhibitor X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), and the cellular IAPs 1 (c-IAP1) and 2 (c-IAP2). This inhibits the activities of these IAPs and promotes the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, as xevinapant inhibits the activity of IAPs, it may work synergistically with cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation to overcome tumor cell resistance to apoptosis. As IAPs regulate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathways, which drives the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, xevinapant may enhance anti-tumor immune responses when administered with certain immunomodulating agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. IAPs are overexpressed by many cancer cell types and suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting active caspases via their baculoviral lAP repeat (BIR) domains. They contribute to chemo-radio-resistance of cancer cells to certain cytotoxic agents and radiation, promote tumor cell survival and are associated with poor prognosis in certain types of cancer. SMAC, a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein, is an endogenous inhibitor of the IAPs family of cellular proteins."

42507,zoledronic acid,"A synthetic imidazole bisphosphonate analog of pyrophosphate with anti-bone-resorption activity. A third-generation bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their dissolution and inhibiting the formation and aggregation of these crystals. This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. Decreased bone turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the analgesic effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic lesions. The agent also reduces serum calcium concentrations associated with hypercalcemia. "

Upon administration, zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted stimulates the host immune system to induce both specific CD4-positive T-cells and antibodies against VZV gE, thereby protecting against infection with HZ. VZV gE, the most common antigen in VZV viral particles, plays a key role in VZV infection. Compared to live-attenuated vaccines, the subunit vaccine prevents the risk of vaccine-induced HZ in immunocompromised patients. "
43659,zosuquidar trihydrochloride,"A difluorocyclopropyl quinoline. Zosuquidar trihydrochloride binds with high affinity to P-glycoprotein and inhibits P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR). P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR-1 gene, is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transmembrane transporters and prevents the intracellular accumulation of many natural product-derived cytotoxic agents."
800362,zotatifin,"A selective inhibitor of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of zotatifin, this agent targets and binds to elF4A, and promotes eIF4A binding to mRNA with specific polypurine motifs within their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), leading to the formation of a stable sequence-specific ternary complex with eIF4A and mRNA (elF4A- zotatifin-mRNA). This results in the translational repression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, such as KRAS, Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, cyclin D, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 and 2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2), and beta-catenin. The inhibition of the expression of these oncogenes leads to the inhibition of various oncogenic signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. eIF4A, a RNA helicase and the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, catalyzes the ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA duplexes and facilitates 43S ribosome scanning within the 5'-UTR. elF4A is activated by various oncogenic signaling pathways, including RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, and regulates the translation of oncogenes and tumor survival factors with complex secondary structures within the 5'-UTRs that are required for tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis."
